# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel pretty confident in my understanding and fluency with the comparison operators. I have a good grasp on what the different symbols mean in regards to less than, greater than, not equal to, and stricly equal to.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I feel confident in my understanding and fluency with the logical operators. I understand && means and, || means or, etc. It gets tougher when these start getting combined, and that's where I need some additional work.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I've definitely learned a lot about logical flow for if statements through this lesson. The spicy coding challenge in particular helped increase my confidence.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I spent about 3 hours on this lesson, which is far greater than I had estimated. I feel as if I didn't have to do all three challenges, but I felt I got a lot out of it.


1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to learn how to explain my code more thoroughly. I will do that through practice and reinforcing concepts through study. I will add some study time to my calendar to do this.


1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't really have any additiional questions right now, but I will be sure to ask my peers or instructors on Slack should I have any additional questions or use Google.
